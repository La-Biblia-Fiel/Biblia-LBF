# STATUS

Four states: `none` | `draft` | `ready` | `done`.
How to work: `WORKFLOW.md`. How the data may live: `DATA_CONTRACT.md`.

`ready` is written only by `python3 tools/verify.py`. That means the checks
passed. You still approve.

`done` requires a named human on this file **and** a passing `python3 tools/status.py`.

Signed columns stay empty until a human writes a name and an ISO date.

## Open human decisions

Nehemiah 7:68: OSHB/WLC has no source for this Protestant label (WLC Neh 7:68 is Protestant 7:69). First-pass may draft it only from Ezra 2:66 OSHB after explicit confirmation. Still draft until second-pass review. Apocalipsis Spanish: later TR revision accepted. Zacarías 11:2: `el cedro` already applied.

Zacarías (2026-09-16): translation + alignment both `done` (John Wry). Alignment path: structural map accept → AI audit pass → human approval.
